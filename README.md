# Calculator
* Allows user to pick colours for buttons and displayed numbers, for all the wannabe grapheme-colour synaesthetes ; )
* Implements the [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm). This converts infix notation to postfix, which makes evaluation easier and takes care of order of operations.
* Does not use ```eval()```
* Allows typing of expressions in addition to providing buttons.
* This is a [freeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator).
