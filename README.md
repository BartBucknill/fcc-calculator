# Calculator
* Allows user to **pick colours** for buttons and displayed numbers/operators, for all the aspiring grapheme-colour synaesthetes.
* Implements the **[Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm)**. This converts *infix* notation to *postfix*, which makes evaluation easier and takes care of order of operations.
* Does not use ```eval()```
* Allows **typing of expressions** on keyboard in addition to providing clickable buttons.
* This is a [freeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator).
